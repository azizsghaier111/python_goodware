It may return None to indicate that the default module\n        creation code should be used. One use case, though atypical, for\n        create_module() is to provide a module that is a subclass of the\n        builtin module type. Most loaders will not need to implement\n        create_module(),\n\n        create_module() should properly handle the case where it is called\n        more than once for the same spec/module.

As is currently the case without the PEP-452, if a\n        loader would be costly to create, that loader can be designed to defer\n        the cost until later.\n\n        Finders must return ModuleSpec objects when find_spec() is called.\n        This new method replaces find_module() and find_loader() (in the\n        PathEntryFinder case).
