Like `tf.summary.scalar`\n    points, text points are each associated with a `step` and a `name`.\n    All the points with the same `name` constitute a time series of text values.\n\n    For Example:\n    ```python\n    test_summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('test/logdir')\n    with test_summary_writer.as_default():\n        tf.summary.text('first_text', 'hello world!', step=0)\n        tf.summary.text('first_text', 'nice to meet you!', step=1)\n    ```\n\n    The text summary can also contain Markdown, and TensorBoard will render the text\n    as such.\n\n    ```python\n    with test_summary_writer.as_default():\n        text_data = '''\n              | *hello* | *there* |\n              |---------|---------|\n              | this    | is      |\n              | a       | table   |\n        '''\n        text_data = '\\n'.join(l.strip() for l in text_data.splitlines())\n        tf.summary.text('markdown_text', text_data, step=0)\n    ```\n\n    Since text is Tensor valued, each text point may be a Tensor of string values.\n    rank-1 and rank-2 Tensors are rendered as tables in TensorBoard.  For higher ranked\n    Tensors, you'll see just a 2D slice of the data.  To avoid this, reshape the Tensor\n    to at most rank-2 prior to passing it to this function.\n\n    Demo notebook at\n    [\"Displaying text data in TensorBoard\"](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/text_summaries).\n\n    Arguments:\n      name: A name for this summary.
